### Hi, I'm Kenneth ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software developer in Fort Worth, Texas. I currently work at [Zeal IT Consultants](https://zealitconsultants.com), a small boutique software consulting company. 

### At my job I'm:
- currently working on [Hoot! Books](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hoot-books/id1525765826), a children's book app built with Flutter
- leading a weekly tech book club ðŸ“•

### Cool things I've worked on:
- [PII Redacting ML System](https://blog.usejournal.com/using-machine-learning-to-redact-personal-identifying-information-b95b53b935a9) - Automatic redaction of personal identifying information from tax documents with Machine Learning (Semantic Segmentation). 
- [Vendorzs](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1520278336) - A Flutter application that event creators can use to schedule and manage vendors. 
- [Clarity AR - 1st Place HackUTA](https://devpost.com/software/clarity-sc8vjo) - A winning project that uses mixed reality AR + VR to help insurance companies better recreate and clarify accident scenes
- [GameBoard - 2nd Place HackTX](https://devpost.com/software/gameboard) - Android app that uses WiFi p2p to dynamically create a map across multiple devices to play collaborative games with
- [Where's my CheddAR](https://devpost.com/software/where-s-my-cheddar) - An IOS + React paired application that teaches kids about programming!

### In my off time I'm:
- Working on a project to help users **deliberately practice and remember Python skills**. I come from a classical music background and one thing I miss from 
the field is the huge importance placed on rapidly developing and improving one's skills using deliberate practice. 
- Raising three kids with the love of my life
- Trying as many local taco and barbecue spots in Fort Worth as I can manage.
